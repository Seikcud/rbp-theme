            <p>Thoroughly read through our <a href="/about" target="_blank">about us</a> page to learn more about how we operate as a guild before applying. Our current recruitment goals are often posted where we advertise, but anyone who thinks they have the skill or determination to raid with us should apply. We only ask that you fill out your application completely or it will reflect poorly on you're desire to join us.</p>
            <p>After submitting your application, you will be redirected to your submitted application so you may respond to comments or questions asked by officers. You will be notified of any status updates or comments made to your application through email. We'd prefer you add a comment to your application asking for a status update instead of trying to contact someone in-game.</p>
