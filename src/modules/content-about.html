          <div class="panel-block">
            <p>
              Trials are evaluated over an approximate three-week period in which the trial participates in boss kills. The
              duration of the trial and its methodology are at the discretion of
              the officers. What content the trial is brought to is
              dependent on their gear, experience, and our current progression
              schedule. Certain progression decisions, like holding a lockout to
              work on a progression boss, can elongate a trialing period.
              However, if we see the trial perform to our satisfaction in raids,
              and with no glaring problems as discussed between the officers and
              the trial, they will be promoted to Raider. Failing a trial may result in
              retrialing, demotion to a social rank, or removal from the guild.
            </p>
            <p>
              Trials are required to understand our policies and carry out the
              expectations we expect of all our raiders. Adaptation to our
              policies and practices is something an Officer will look at as
              part of the evaluation.

          <div class="panel-caption">
            We utilize a proxy based loot council system for determining where

          <div class="panel-block--title">Our Loot Philosophy</div>
          <div class="panel-block">
            <p>
              Loot council acts to reach a happy medium between quickly
              distributing loot, and maximizing group performance so that gear
              ends up hitting bosses. It enables us to maintain our goal of
              being a competitive two-night guild, which requires that we
              prioritize the bulk of our time and effort working on bosses, not
              loot. The council quickly gathers and processes a multitude of
              data from raiders in order to converge on a decision. A personal
              loot system would not give raiders such immediate information,
              stalling loot distribution as everyone discusses to whom loot
              should be awarded. Raiders can worry about trash and preparing for
              the next boss while the council deliberates.
            </p>
            <p>
              Raiders are considered for items based on their
              <span class="panel-important">performance</span>,
              <span class="panel-important">attendance</span>, and
              <span class="panel-important">rank</span>. How much weight these
              factors are given is entirely dependent on our current progression
              needs and goals. Officers retain the right to distribute loot for
              any reason to benefit the guild or its ideals, or to weaken or
              strengthen the council.

                The numerical and mechanical aptitude of our players is

          <div class="panel-block--title">Council Decision Making</div>
          <div class="panel-block">
            <p>
              Officers will make decisions using criteria not limited to what's
              described above. Every council decision is to better align the
              guild with our current goals. This may mean gearing a particular
              role or new trial instramental to our progression, avoiding
              situations of extreme gear inequality, or decidedly not rewarding a player who is demonstrating a bout of unreliability.
            </p>
            <p>
              For instance, attendance is a good foundation for giving out gear,
              but a boss dynamic may suddenly require our best raid performance.
              Similarly, no matter how reliable a player is their specialization may not be the focus for an upcoming
              boss. When we aren't in the heat of progression, the principles by
              which we evaluate our raiders will plateau, making gearing
              decisions more tedious and less important. We may disable or
              diminish the council for specific farm bosses, or favor the player
              who looted the item in tie-breaking situations.
            </p>
            <p>
              Through and through, we make decisions with the entire raid in
              mind, not to the whimsy of an individual player. Gear isn't a
              reward we pile onto the exceptional players, but a brick-by-brick
              foundation we build across the entire raid to support our goals.

                  Whenever someone loots a boss, RCLootCouncil will detect any
                  tradeable items they've received and forwards what they are to
                  the council's voting table. The council will receive the items
                  as players loot the boss, so everyone should quickly loot the
                  boss and move on to trash. Do not hover over an item on the
                  body without looting it, as we will all have to wait for you
                  to loot it before everyone can see the item.

                  As the items arrive, a popup will appear for all raiders,

                  you to categorize what the item means to you. Best in Raid
                  implies this item is the best item you can get in this slot
                  from the raid; once you have it you'll only want the same item
                  at a higher item level or something from a Mythic+. Mainspec
                  means there is something better in the raid than this item,
                  but this is still an upgrade for your raiding specialization.
                  Offspec means you'd use it for alternative content, and
                  transmog for aesthetical reasons.

                  what percentage of an upgrade the item is, e.g. "5% upgrade,"
                  as determined from your stat weights. Failure to include a

                  able to detect what you're wearing if you're too far away from
                  the master looter, but everyone should be working on trash after a boss dies.

                  Once the officers have voted and the master looter assigned
                  the item to someone, the player who looted the item will be
                  presented with this popup window. If the "Trade" text is red,
                  you're too far away, green and you're in range. Simply click
                  the text and it will open a trade for you to trade the item to
                  that person.

            <p>
              Joining our roster means you agree to distributing your received
              items by proxy through a loot council. Under no circumstances is
              anyone allowed to undermine the loot council by equipping,
              trading, destroying, or concealing items without express
              permission from the council. Doing so would be synonymous with
              ninja-looting, to which we have a zero-tolerance policy.

            <p>
              These addons require essentially no setup from our raiders, just
              ensure they're enabled and updated frequently using something like
              the <a href="https://app.twitch.tv/download">Twitch Client</a>.
              Exorsus Raid Tools has a few features the officers may
              require you to enable depending on your role, such as raid cooldown bars for healers,
              external cooldowns for tanks, or interrupt notes for DPS.
