                    <div class="panel-block">
                        <p>Trials are evaluated over an approximate two-week period, or four raid nights, in which the trial participates in boss kills. The duration of the trial and its methodology are at the discretion of the role officer. What content the trial is brought to is dependent on their gear, experience, and our current progression schedule. Certain progression decisions, like holding a lockout to work on a progression boss, can elongate a trialing period. However, if we see the trial perform to our satisfaction in raids, and with no glaring problems as discussed between the officer and the trial, they will be promoted to Raider Rank 1. Promoting a trial to Raider Rank 1 means we think they have merit, but will need to prove themselves further. Failing a trial may result in retrialing, demotion to a social rank, or removal from the guild.</p>
                        <p>Trials are required to understand our policies and carry out the expectations we expect of all our raiders. Adaptation to our policies and practices is something an Officer will look at as part of the evaluation.</p>
                        <p>Raider Rank 1 is where we consider someone a raider in our guild, but it comes with another minimum two-week evaluation period. It is at Raider Rank 1 where Officers will ensure the raider can demonstrate our required qualities simultaneously, and not sway between being good at mechanics while not numerically, or vice versa, while maintaining their attendance.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="panel-block--title">Bimonthly Demotions</div>
                    <div class="panel-block">
                        <p>Every 2 months the officers will evaluate the Raider Rank 2's and demote any who no longer demonstrate the qualities the rank requires. The role officer will discuss with the raider about what they need to improve and monitor their progress until they can be promoted back to Raider Rank 2. If the issue is unresolved for some time, the recruitment officer will step in and try to replace these players.</p>
                        <p>Ranks are the effect to which performance, mechanics, and attendance are the cause. Loot council considers ranks as a snapshot of reliability; a culmination of the qualities in the previous two-month interval. Ranks are for the raider, and the raid, to see where everyone stands, but is not a primary drive of loot council or raid spot assignments.</p>

                    <div class="panel-block">
                        <p>Loot council acts to reach a happy medium between quickly distributing loot, and maximizing group performance so that gear ends up hitting bosses. It enables us to maintain our goal of being a competitive two-night guild, which requires that we prioritize the bulk of our time and effort working on bosses, not loot. The council quickly gathers and processes a multitude of data from raiders in order to converge on a decision. A personal loot system would not give raiders such immediate information, stalling loot distribution as everyone discusses to whom loot should be awarded. Raiders can worry about trash and preparing for the next boss while the council deliberates.</p>
                        <p>Raiders are considered for items based on their <span class="panel-important">performance</span>, <span class="panel-important">attendance</span>, and <span class="panel-important">rank</span>. How much weight these factors are given is entirely dependent on our current progression needs and goals. Officers retain the right to distribute loot for any reason to benefit the guild or its ideals, or to weaken or strengthen the council.</p>

                        <p>Officers will make decisions using criteria not limited to what's described above. Every council decision is to better align the guild with our current goals. This may mean gearing a particular role or new trial instramental to our progression, avoiding situations of extreme gear inequality, or not rewarding a bout of poor raider reliability not yet reflected through ranks.</p>
                        <p>For instance, attendance is a good foundation for giving out gear, but a boss dynamic may suddenly require our best raid performance. Similarly, no matter how reliable a player is, as shown by their rank, their specialization may not be the focus for an upcoming boss. When we aren't in the heat of progression, the principles by which evaluate our raiders will plateau, making gearing decisions more tedious and less important. We may disable or diminish the council for specific farm bosses, or favor the player who looted the item in tie-breaking situations.</p>
                        <p>Through and through, we make decisions with the entire raid in mind, not to the whimsy of an individual player. Gear isn't a reward we pile onto the exceptional players, but a brick-by-brick foundation we build across the entire raid to support our goals.</p>

                                <p>Officers will be presented with the following table of voters for each item, listing the button they pressed along with their note. Character information such as overall equipped item level, and links to the item(s) in the slot(s) of the same item type. Historically, the addon will sometimes not be able to detect what you're wearing if you're too far away from the master looter.</p>
                                <p>The person who is holding the item will have a little money bag symbol next to their character, denoting it's currently in their bags.</p>
                                <p>While we know how much of an item level boost this item is, we do not know how the stats fare for each and every specialization. Everyone is required to include a note describing how much of an ugprade it is in a percentage, like "5% upgrade." Saying something is a "huge upgrade", or other vague terms is not helpful and will prompt us to ask you for more useful information.</p>

Under no circumstances is anyone allowed to undermine the loot council by equipping, trading, destroying, or concealing items without express permission from the council. Doing so would be synonymous with ninja-looting, to which we have a zero-tolerance policy.</p>
